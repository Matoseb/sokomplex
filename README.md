# sokomplex

*[Sokomplex](https://sokomplex.app)* pays tribute to the Sokoban puzzle video game series, first released in 1982. The main purpose was to push boxes onto target squares in a labyrinth. The contribution of a three-dimensional environment entirely composed of cubes now allows the use of brand new game mechanics, thus considerably varying the gameplay. This open universe makes it possible to move away from the well-known level system of "puzzle games".

Designed using web technologies, the game is available on a multitude of connected platforms.

New levels will be added soon, hopefully.
